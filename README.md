# README Generator

This is a command-line application built with Node.js that allows users to dynamically generate Markdown content for their README files. The application uses the Inquirer package to prompt the user for input regarding their project, including the title, description, installation instructions, usage information, license choice, contribution guidelines, test instructions, and contact email. Based on the user's input, the application generates a formatted README.md file with sections for each piece of information provided.
